# CDP Support Agent Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a web-based chatbot designed to answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): **Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap**. The chatbot extracts information from the official documentation of these platforms and provides relevant guidance to users. It mimics a support agent experience, handling various question types and offering a user-friendly interface.

## Objective
The goal is to develop a chatbot that:
- Answers "how-to" questions (e.g., "How do I set up a new source in Segment?")
- Extracts relevant information from CDP documentation.
- Handles question variations (e.g., long questions, irrelevant queries).
- Optionally supports cross-CDP comparisons and advanced queries.

This project focuses on software engineering principles rather than advanced NLP model building, using a simple document indexing approach.

## Data Sources
The chatbot uses the following official documentation:

- **Segment**: [https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav](https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav)
- **mParticle**: [https://docs.mparticle.com/](https://docs.mparticle.com/)
- **Lytics**: [https://docs.lytics.com/](https://docs.lytics.com/)
- **Zeotap**: [https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/](https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/)

- **Express**: A minimal web framework for handling API requests.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for fetching documentation pages.
- **Cheerio**: jQuery-like library for parsing HTML.
- **Lunr.js**: Lightweight search engine for document indexing.

### Frontend

## Data Structures
### Documentation JSON Format
The scraped data is stored in JSON files under the `backend/data/` directory.

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "cdp": "Segment",
    "page": "Home",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "content": "Segment allows you to collect data from various sources..."
  },
  {
    "cdp": "Segment",
    "page": "Home",
    "section": "Setting Up Sources",
    "content": "To set up a source, navigate to the Sources tab..."
  }
]
